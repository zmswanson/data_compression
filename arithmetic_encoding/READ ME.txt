Swanson Arithmetic READ ME
==========================
If you are reading this, then Zach Swanson has FINALLY gotten
off his lazy bum and finished a data compression project.
So now the question is, does the Swanson Arithmetic encoder
and decoder actually work? Let's see.
--------------------------
This program was coded in C and compiled on a Windows
machine and is intended to be ran from a command prompt.

The program was structured to take a file of any type and
sequentially run the arithmetic encoder and decoder. The 
program outputs two new files: a compressed file and a
decompressed file. These files are provided to ensure the
user that the encoder and decoder are doing what they are
intended and required to do. The program will also provide
the user with reports on compression and decompression 
performance. I.E., how much was the file compressed and how
well does the decompressed file match the original.
-----------------------------------------------------------
If you have the capability to run '.exe' files, then 
follow these steps to run the program.

1. From a command prompt, go to the directory containing
   "ArithComp.exe"

2. Type the following: "ArithComp.exe arg1 arg2 arg3"
   where "arg1" is the name of the file to be compressed,
   "arg2" is a name, any name, to store the compressed file,
   and "arg3" is the name of a file to hold the decompressed
   file. For "arg3" be sure to use a different file name than
   "arg1" but use the same file type.
      e.g. - ArithComp.exe  original.txt  comp.z  dcmp.txt

   Note: It is easiest to place the file to be compressed in the
      same directory as ArithComp.exe. If not, be sure to specify
      the path to the file to be compressed in the command line.

3. If all goes well, the results mentioned above should be
   experienced and I can rest easily with more thing checked
   off the ol' to-do list.
---------------------------------------------------------------
If you do not have the capability to run '.exe' files but do
have a C compliler on your machine, please compile the four
files listed below. Then follow the instructions in step 2 above.

   gcc main.c bit_manipulation.c arithmetic_encoder.c   ...
            arithmetic_decoder.c
